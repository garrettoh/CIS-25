# This is a Repo for CIS-25 Projects
First week, implemented user input validation and sanitization aswell as a simple menu to navigate around the various projects
## Ideas I currently have
FINAL PROJECT: As a security researcher, I'm interested in Maldev, so creating malware for the final project would be interesting. However, I'm currently debating between that and a Packer/Crypter.
## Things to add/learn
##### Better UI,
##### More familiarity with LeetCode concepts like Data Structures and Algorithms 
##### Actually learn nvim so I can be a lore accurate Arch Linux guy
### Check out the rest of my profile to see what I'm doing in my free time :)
