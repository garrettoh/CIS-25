# C++ Projects - Assingments 10 & 11
This project is part of a C++ course assignment focused on modular programming using header files. The objective is to demonstrate proper separation of interface and implementation in C++ by creating and using a custom class across multiple source files.

# Assignment 10
## ðŸ“„ Description

The program defines and uses a custom `Item` class in a modular structure:

- `Item.h`: The header file containing the class declaration.
- `Item.cpp`: The implementation file containing method definitions.
- `main.cpp`: The main driver that creates and manipulates `Item` objects.

The output of the program is saved in `output.pdf` as per the assignment requirements.

## ðŸ§± File Structure

Assignment10/
â”œâ”€â”€ Item.cpp # Implementation of Item class methods
â”œâ”€â”€ Item.h # Declaration of Item class
â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp # Program entry point and usage of Item class
â””â”€â”€ output.pdf # Output or report generated by the program

## ðŸš€ How to Compile

To compile the project using `g++`:

```bash
cd Assignment10
g++ main.cpp Item.cpp -o assignment10
```

Then run the program:
```bash
./assignment10
```
# Assignment 11
## ðŸ§± File Structure
Assignment11/
â”œâ”€â”€ User.h        # Declaration of the User class
â”œâ”€â”€ User.cpp      # Implementation of User methods
â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp      # Entry point that uses the User class
â””â”€â”€ output.pdf    # Program output or supporting documentation


## ðŸš€ How to Compile

```bash
cd Assignment11
g++ main.cpp User.cpp -o assignment11
./assignment11
```
